# LokAI

I believe that the people whose data an AI is trained on, should own a percentage of the AI. I would like to research and develop a protocol which respect this.

I envision collecting specific data, and then train an AI on that data - in a manner which respects the rough protocol described above. The specific data would be used to fine-tune opensource foundation models.
